	<p class="info">The game is playable for 3 players. <br>Players take turns to add lines to
		the board.<br>In each turn, a player can add a line by clicking on two adjacent dots, which will result in a line being formed between those two dots (the color of the line will be the same as the player's color). <br>Whenever a player completes a box, they get a point, in addition to another turn. <br>The game finishes when someone claims the last box. <br>The winner is the player who has the most boxes. </p>
